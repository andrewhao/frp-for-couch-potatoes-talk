Reactive Programming for Couch Potatoes
---------------------------------------

## Abstract

You've heard the yapping about reactive programming and how it's the
bee's knees, but you can't figure out how it works, and all the mathtalk
that comes up on Wikipedia is confusing to you.

Together, we'll discuss the principles of FRP and streams (oh my). We'll take the concepts 
apart and explain them in plain english.

We'll take a fun example from the physical world - using a device
accelerometer - and with a little bit of gumption, elbow grease, and
basic math, we'll come up with a rudimentary pedometer (step counter)!

We'll even talk a little bit about how these concepts apply to real
world frameworks like React, Flux, and Elm. In the end, you'll not only
get up to speed about reactive streams, you'll be able to have clear
steps to implement reactive programming principles in your next project.
