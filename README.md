Reactive Programming for Couch Potatoes
---------------------------------------

## Abstract

You've heard the yapping about reactive programming and how it's the bee's knees.
But... you can't figure out how it works, and all the math-talk that comes up on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_reactive_programming) is confusing to you.

Together, we'll go through FRP principles of streams, functions, and data-flow.
We'll take the concepts apart with pictures and diagrams and explain them in plain english.

We'll take a fun example from the physical world - with an HTML5 device
accelerometer and with a little bit of gumption, elbow grease, and
basic math, we'll come up with a rudimentary pedometer (step counter)!

We'll even talk a little bit about how these concepts apply to real
world frameworks like React, Flux, and Elm. In the end, you'll not only
get up to speed about reactive streams, you'll be able to have new insights and tools
to implement reactive programming principles in your next project!
